            How to start dropshipping on Shopify
          </strong>
          <p>
            Shopify dropshipping is one of the best ways to get started with ecommerce. Here I’ll take you through the process of setting up a dropshipping store on the Shopify platform.

          </p>
          <div class="section">
              <strong class="text-danger">Create a Shopify account (Free Trial) </strong> 
              <p>
                It’s really easy to create a Shopify account. At the time of writing this <strong class="text-danger"> Shopify is offering a free 14-day trial</strong>. which gives you plenty of time to try it out before you commit to a monthly plan.
              </p>
              <p>
                You need to choose a name for your Shopify store. This will create a website for you that looks like this:
                 <br><strong>yourstorename. myshopify</strong>
              </p>

              <img src="/assets/blogs/how_to_start_dropshiping/Create a Shopify account.png">
              <p>
                You will probably want to create a custom domain name for your store so it doesn’t really matter what your Shopify store name is.

              </p>
              <p>
                However, you should still use something that’s relevant to your store and niche, even if nobody else ever sees it.

              </p>
            <div class="steps text-center"><strong>1</strong></div>
          </div>
          <div class="section">
              <strong class="text-danger">Building your store</strong>
              <img src="../assets/blogs/how_to_start_dropshiping/building_your_store.png" alt="">
              <p>
                Once you’ve created an account you’ll be asked to enter some basic information about yourself and then be taken to Shopify’s main dashboard. <br><br>
                Now you can start setting up your store.
                
              </p>
              <strng class="text-success">Choosing a theme</strng>
              <p>
                I recommend starting with the fun part - choosing a theme for your store. You just have to click on the ‘Online Store’ tab and then ‘Themes’. <br><br>
                Shopify has eight free themes, which are fine to get you started. Or you can visit the Theme Store and pay for a premium theme. <br><br>
                Once you’ve found a theme you like, click “Add to theme library”. You can add a few themes to your library if you want to test a few out. Or just choose one and run with it.
                
              </p>
              <strong class="text-success">
                Customizing your theme   
              </strong>
              <p>
                This is one of the most important parts of creating a successful dropshipping store on Shopify. <br><br>
                It’s where you get to flex your creative muscles to make people want to buy your products. <br><br>
                The two most important places to focus on are the homepage and product page. <br><br>
                You need to ensure that you have: <br>
                ●	Accurate, persuasive copy and <br>
                ●	Attractive, high-quality images <br><br> 
                When writing your copy, try and focus on benefits rather than features. How will your product make their life better, easier, healthier or safer? Tell your website visitors a story in which they are the lead character. <br><br>
                Another effective copywriting method is to present a problem that your target audience might be facing and offer your product as the solution they’ve always wanted. <br><br>
                You should be able to source product photos from your dropshipping supplier. But if you have access to a decent camera, you should take your own photos and videos. Include photos and videos of the product being used as well as generic images. <br><br>
                If you want high-quality free stock images, check out websites like <a href="https://unsplash.com/">Unsplash</a> and <a href="">Pexels.</a> <br>
                If you get stuck, just go and look at what other online stores do with their copy and images to get some inspiration. <br><br>
                With a Shopify dropshipping store, you’re not going to be able to compete too aggressively on price, so you’ll need to get creative with how you sell your product with copy and images. <br>

                
              </p>
              <strong class="text-success">Creating a logo</strong>
              <p>
                Every successful online store needs a professional-looking logo. It boosts credibility and makes you look like an established brand. <br><br>
                I recommend heading over to <a href="https://www.canva.com/">Canva</a> and using one of their free logo templates.
  
              </p>
              <strong class="text-success">Importing products to your store</strong>
              <img src="../assets/blogs/how_to_start_dropshiping/Importing products to your store.png" alt="">
              <p>
                Most dropshippers source their products from Aliexpress. If you’re doing this, you can use a tool like <strong class="text-danger">SaleHoo Dropship</strong> to import products from <strong class="text-danger">Aliexpress to Shopify</strong> in minutes. No copying and pasting product information and photos, just a couple of clicks and you’re done.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you want to <strong class="text-danger">automate your dropshipping store (my blog) [very important]</strong> further, you can set it up so that your supplier receives orders and ships them to your customers without you having to do anything.
              </p>
              <p>
                If your supplier provides you with a .CSV file, you can import products using the ‘Import’ link at the top of the screen.

              </p>
              <p>
                The other option is to add products manually using the ‘Add product’ button. <br><br>
                Whatever method you use, make sure to check and double check your product information, including images and variants (colors, sizes etc). 
                 
              </p>
              <strong class="text-success">Optimizing your product pages</strong>
              <p>
                If you’re using paid ads to drive traffic to your Shopify store, you’ll probably send people straight to your product page. <br>
                Therefore, your product page needs to be compelling and address customer concerns and objections. <br>
                That way, you’ll make more sales, which is the whole point of ecommerce, right? <br>
                Here are a few tips for optimizing your Shopify product page: <br>

                
              </p>
              <div class="pl-5">
                  <strong>1.	High-quality images</strong>
                  <p>
                    Your product images are the first thing people look at when they’re thinking about buying. Make sure you have high-resolution images taken from every possible angle. Include images of your product in use or being worn by a model.

                  </p>
                  <strong>
                    2.	Create an irresistible headline
                  </strong>
                  <p>
                    After your images, the headline is the first bit of text that captures people’s attention. Use it to deliver the core benefit of your product, or as a teaser that makes them want to learn more.

                  </p>
                  <strong>3.	Highlight benefits first</strong>
                  <p>
                    You want to make sure you answer all of your customers’ obvious questions in your product description. Include the size, weight, materials used, accessories - everything a customer could possibly want to know.

                  </p>
                  <strong>4.	Include all the product features</strong>
                  <p>
                    You want to make sure you answer all of your customers’ obvious questions in your product description. Include the size, weight, materials used, accessories - everything a customer could possibly want to know.

                  </p>
                  <strong>5.	Have a clear call to action</strong>
                  <p>
                    You need to tell visitors what you want them to do next. “Buy now” or “Add to cart” are the most obvious ones. Make sure your call to action is easy to see and understand

                  </p>
                  <strong>6.	Use psychological pricing</strong>
                  <p>
                    Use .99 or include a % discount, or the original price next to the sale price. All of these things might seem obvious, but they genuinely help with conversions.

                  </p>
                  <strong>7.	Offer free worldwide shipping</strong>
                  <p>
                    When you’re dropshipping, I highly advise offering free worldwide shipping. It just eliminates a major obstacle to getting a sale. You just have to add the shipping cost into your product price.

                  </p>
                  <strong>8.	Add ratings and reviews</strong>
                  <p>
                    Even if you haven’t made a sale, you can import ratings and reviews from AliExpress using AliExpress Review Importer in the Shopify app store. This provides social proof, which gives customers confidence to purchase.

                  </p>
                  <strong>9.	Include trust badges</strong>
                  <p>
                    You should use Shopify apps to add trust badges - credit card logos, secure checkout, 100% satisfaction guarantee - to boost your credibility and give customers confidence to buy from you.

                  </p>
                  <strong>10.	Use an auto currency converter</strong>
                  <p>
                    Nothing will turn a customer off faster than seeing prices displayed in a foreign currency. A currency converter app automatically displays prices in each customer’s home currency, based on their IP address.

                  </p>
              </div>
              <p>
                Whatever you do, don’t use the copy provided by your supplier or taken from Aliexpress. Completely rewrite it so that it’s original and creative and more relevant to your target customers.

              </p>
              <strong class="text-success">Adding a custom domain</strong>
              <p>You don’t have to add a custom domain, but I recommend that you do. Having a “myshopify” domain looks tacky and unprofessional.</p>
              <p>You can buy a new domain through Shopify or connect or transfer an existing domain. </p>
              <p>A custom domain will cost you about $14 to $20 USD per year</p>
              <div class="steps text-center"><strong>2</strong></div>
          </div>
          <div class="section">
              <strong class="text-danger">Optimizing your Shopify settings </strong>
              <p>
                This is the more technical part of setting up your dropshipping store on Shopify, but it’s essential that you get this right from the beginning.

              </p>
              <strong class="text-success">Payment settings </strong>
              <img src="../assets/blogs/how_to_start_dropshiping/Payment settings.png" alt="">
              <p>The first thing you should do is set up payment options for your store. Click ‘Settings’ and then ‘Payment providers’.
                   </p>
              <p>From here you can set up Shopify Payments, which accepts most credit cards, Apple Pay, Google Pay and more

              </p>
              <p>You can also set up Paypal, Amazon Pay and other third-party providers.</p>
              <p>The more options you provide customers with, the more sales you’re likely to make. At the very least, you should be using Shopify Payments and Paypal. 

              </p>
              <strong class="text-success">Store policies </strong>
              <p>
                You should add relevant policies and legal information to your dropshipping store. <br>
                This helps to provide you with some basic safety nets should you have any issues or disputes with customers.
                
              </p>
              <img src="../assets/blogs/how_to_start_dropshiping/store.png" alt="">
              <p>
                Click on ‘Settings’ then ‘Legal’. <br>
                Here you can add a Refund policy, Privacy policy, Terms of service, Shipping policy and Legal notice. <br>
                You can write your own policies or consult a lawyer for advice. But Shopify provides really good templates for these policies which you can customize to suit your store. <br>
                Just click on ‘Create from template’ and change the wording a bit. <br>
                
              </p>

              <strong class="text-success">Shipping settings</strong>
              <img src="../assets/blogs/how_to_start_dropshiping/Shipping settings.png" alt="">
              <p>You need to set up your shipping settings so that your customers know what to expect when they buy from you.</p>
              <p>From a Shopify dropshipping store, I highly recommend offering free worldwide shipping. This is what most dropshipping stores do to help increase conversions.</p>
              <p>You can just incorporate the shipping costs, which are usually only a few dollars, into your product price.</p>
              <p>To set up shipping rates, click on ‘Settings’ and then ‘Shipping’.</p>
              <strong class="text-success">Notification settings</strong>
              <p>Finally, I recommend customizing your notification emails to customers so that they are more personalized and aligned with your brand. <br>
                Notifications are automated emails or messages customers get when they buy from you, like the order confirmation emails you get when you purchase something online. <br>
                Shopify provides basic templates, but you should add your own flavor and include your store logo. <br>
                To do this, click on ‘Settings’ and then ‘Notifications’. <br>
                </p>
             <img src="../assets/blogs/how_to_start_dropshiping/Payment settings.png" alt="">
             <p>
                I recommend customizing Order confirmation, abandoned checkout and Shipping confirmation. <br><br>
                The rest don’t matter quite as much when you’re starting out, but as you become more established you should create customized notifications for all customer communication.
