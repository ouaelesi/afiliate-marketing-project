            In this blog you will gain a better idea of what is web development
            and what a web developer actually does and what your life might look
            like if you decided to take it on as a career or a side hustle.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hopefully you will have the motivation to start learning web
            development and start building your own project which will may be
            very interesting and make you famous and rich.

            <b class="text-primary">What is Web Development ?</b>
            <p>
              // also known as web programming <br />
              Web development is the process of creating websites and
              applications for the Internet, or for a private network known as
              an intranet. Web development is not concerned with website design;
              Instead, it's all about the code and scripting that supports the
              website's functionality. <br />

              Web development can be divided into three layers: client-side
              coding (front end) and server-side coding (backend)
            </p>
            <div class="pl-5">
              <p>
                <b>a- </b>Client-side (The front-end): Client-side code is
                executed in a web browser and is directly related to what people
                see and interact with when they visit a website. Things like
                layout, fonts, colors, menus, and contact forms are all front
                driven.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>b- </b>Server-side (The back-end): Server-side scripting, or
                backend development, is about what happens behind the scenes.
                The backend is basically a part of the website that the user
                does not actually see. It is responsible for storing and
                organizing the data, and making sure that everything on the
                client side is running smoothly. It does this by communicating
                with the front end. When something happens on the client side -
                for example when a user enters their information to log in to a
                website, that information is stored on the server using
                server-side scripting

              >The difference between Web Development and Web Design:</b
            >
            <p>
              You may hear the terms web development and web design used
              interchangeably, but these are two completely different things.
            </p>
            <p>
              Imagine a web designer and web developer working together to build
              a machine: the developer will be concerned with the functional
              components while the designer will be responsible for the visuals
              - what the vehicle looks like - and the user experience that a
              vehicle provides, whether it's a smooth drive or not
            </p>
            <p>
              Web designers design how a site looks and feels. They represent
              website layout, and they make sure it's logical, easy-to-use, and
              fun to use. They think about all the different visual elements:
              What color schemes and fonts will be used? What buttons, drop-down
              menus, and scroll bars should be included, and where? What
              interactive touch points does the user interact with to go from
              point A to point B? Web design also takes into account the
              information structure of a site, and determines what content to
              include and where to place it. <br />Web design is a very broad
              field, and it is often broken down into more specific roles such
              as user experience design, user interface design and information
              engineering.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is the job of a web developer to take this design and develop
              it into a fully functional live website. The front end developer
              takes the visual design as provided by the web designer and builds
              it using markup languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Backend
              developer builds most advanced website functionality, like
              ecommerce website checkout functionality.
              <br />
              => In short, a web designer is the engineer, while a web developer
              is the builder or engineer

            <b class="text-primary">What Does a Web Developer Do?</b>
            <p>
              The role of a web developer is to create and maintain websites.
              Web developers can work at home or independently, and the specific
              tasks and responsibilities will vary depending on whether they
              work as a front-end, back-end, or full-stack developer. Full stack
              developers specialize in both front end and back end; We'll go
              into more detail on what a full stack developer does later
            </p>
            <p>
              Web developers are responsible for building a product that meets
              both the needs of the customer and the needs of the client or end
              user. Web developers collaborate with stakeholders, clients, and
              designers to understand the vision: How should the final website
              appear and function
            </p>
            <p>
              A large part of web development also revolves around identifying
              and fixing errors in order to continually improve and improve your
              website or system. Therefore, web developers are the
              problem-solvers, regularly coming out with workarounds and
              solutions to keep things running smoothly.
            </p>
            <p>
              Web developers are familiar with technology and understand how
              computers and web servers operate. They are also very familiar
              with many software programs, web applications and web programming
              languages, such as hypertext markup language (HTML), JavaScript
              (JS), Ruby on Rails, python, php and C++. They must be able to
              communicate effectively, set goals and meet deadline

              <b>Front-end developers </b> A front-end developer is a web
              developer that encodes the front-end for a website. While web
              design is the way a website appears, front-end development is how
              that design is actually implemented on the web.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Backend developers</b> - A backend developer is someone who
              builds and maintains the technology needed to run components that
              enable the user-facing side of a website to exist. Their back-end
              icon adds utility to everything the front end designer creates.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Full stack developers</b> - Full stack developers understand
              how every part of the web development process occurs and can guide
              strategy and best practices. These developers will have an
              increasingly important role in future web development, and they
              will be able to take a look at the "big picture". They are
              familiar with the server side as well as the client side user
              experience.

            <b class="text-success pl-3">what are the languages?</b>
            <p class="pl-3">
              In the world of web development, languages are the building blocks
              that programmers use to create websites, applications, and
              programs. There are all kinds of different languages, including
              programming languages, markup languages, style sheet languages,
              and database languages.
            </p>
            <b class="text-success">Programming Languages</b>
            <div class="languages_section">
              <p>
                A programming language is basically a set of instructions and
                commands that require a computer to produce a specific output.
                Programmers use so-called "high-level" programming languages to
                write source code. High-level languages use logical words and
                symbols, making them easier for humans to read and understand.
                High-level languages can be classified as either grouped or
                interpreted languages
              </p>
              <p>
                C ++ and Java, for example, are compiled in high-level
                languages; They are first saved in a text-based format that can
                be understood by human programmers rather than computers. For
                the computer to run the source code, it must be converted into a
                low-level language; Any machine code. Compiled languages tend to
                be used to create software applications.
              </p>
              <p>
                Interpreted languages like Perl and PHP do not need compilation.
                Alternatively, the source code written in these languages can be
                run through a compiler - a program that reads and executes the
                code. Localized languages are generally used to run scripts,
                such as those used to create content for dynamic websites.
              </p>
              <p>
                Low-level languages are those that can be recognized and
                implemented directly on computers; They do not need
                interpretation or translation. Machine language and assembly
                language are some common examples of low-level languages.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some of the most popular programming languages for 2018 include
                Java, C, C ++, Python, C #, JavaScript, PHP, Ruby, and Perl.

                programming languages
              </p>
            </div>
            <b class="text-success">Markup languages</b>
            <div class="languages_section">
               <p>
                Markup languages are used to define a text file format. In other words, the markup language tells the program that displays the text how to format the text. The markup languages are perfectly readable with the naked eye - they contain standard words - but the coding marks are not visible in the final output.

               </p>
               <p>The two most popular markup languages are HTML and XML. HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and is used to create websites. When added to a plain text document, HTML tags describe how that document will be displayed by a web browser. To understand how HTML works, let's take the example of bold tags. The HTML version will be written as follows:

               </p>
               
               <code>
                 
              &lt;b&gt; Make this sentence bold! &lt;/b&gt;

 
               </code>
               <p>
                When the browser reads this, it knows to display that sentence in bold. This is what the user sees: <br> <b>Make this sentence bold!</b> 
               </p>
               <p>
                XML stands for Extensible Markup Language. It is a very similar markup language to HTML; However, while HTML is designed to display data with an emphasis on its form, XML is only designed to store and communicate data. Unlike HTML, XML tags are not predefined; Instead, they were created by the author of the document. The goal of XML is to simplify data sharing and transmission, platform changes and data availability, as it provides a software and hardware-independent means of storing, transmitting, and sharing data.
               </p>
               
            </div>
            <b class="text-primary">Style Sheet Languages:</b>
            <div class="languages_section">
              <p>A style sheet is basically a set of stylistic rules. Style sheet languages are used, in the literal sense of the word, to design documents written in markup languages.

              </p>
              <p>Consider a document written in HTML and designed using CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), which is a style sheet language. HTML is responsible for the content and structure of a web page, while CSS determines how that content is presented visually. CSS can be used to add colors, change fonts, and insert backgrounds and borders, as well as pattern styles. CSS is also used to optimize web pages for responsive design, ensuring that they are adapted to whatever device the user uses.

              </p>
            </div>
            <b class="text-success">Database Languages:</b>
            <div class="languages_section">
              <p>Languages are not only used to build websites, software, and applications; It is also used to create and manage databases.</p>
              <p>
                Databases are used to store huge amounts of data. Spotify music, for example, uses databases to store music files, as well as data about a user's listening preferences. Likewise, social media applications such as Instagram use databases to store user profile information; Every time a user updates their profile in some way, the application database will also be updated.
                </p>
              <p>
                Databases are not designed to understand the same languages that applications are programmed into, so it is imperative to have a language they 
              </p>
            </div>
            <b class="text-success">What are libraries and frameworks?</b>
            <p>Web developers also work with libraries and frameworks. Despite a lot of confusion, they are not the same thing - although they exist to make it easier for a developer.

            </p>
            <p>Libraries and frameworks are essentially collections of pre-written code, but libraries are smaller and tend to be used for more specific use cases. The library contains a bunch of helpful code, grouped together for later reuse. The purpose of the library is to enable developers to reach the same end goal while writing less code to get there.</p>
            <p>Let's take the example of JavaScript, the language, and jQuery, which is a JavaScript library. Instead of writing, say, ten lines of code in JavaScript, a developer can take the pre-written condensed version of the jQuery library - saving time and effort.</p>
