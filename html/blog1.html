             Do a Q&amp;A on Instagram Live on how to use your face mask for
            the first time <br />
             Repost user-generated content <br />
             Run a contest <br />
             Make Instagram Stories highlighting product features <br />
             Publish product posts with shopping tags <br />
             Create funny Reels to promote your products <br />
             Publish carousel posts <br />
             Utilize

            products in the beauty sector to maximize your potential sales.

            population, the global nail polish market expects to reach $15.6
            billion by 2024, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of
            9.5%, according to new information from
            <a
              href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/nail-polish-market"
              >Grand View Research</a
            >. According to <a href="">Google Trends</a>, the term “nail polish”
            began trending up again in March 2020, seeing an average of 246,000
            searches per month.

          <img src="../assets/blogs/blog1/ph3.PNG" alt="" />
          <p>
            The younger generation is starting to experiment with new nail
            trends, driving demand for nail products including, enamel, varnish,
            and lacquer. These are expected to be the fastest-growing color
            cosmetics segment because of its innovative textures and effects.

          <img src="../assets/blogs/blog1/ph4.PNG" alt="" />
          <p>
            If you want to turn your nail polish into a bestseller, market this
            trending beauty product on Instagram and Pinterest. Similar to
            peel-off face masks, above, you can find influencers to work with
            and run different social ads to different customer groups to drive
            sales. <br /><br />
            Pinterest is showing a sharp uptick in interest for “nails” and
            related terms, including “nail ideas” and “nail designs”:
          </p>
          <img src="../assets/blogs/blog1/ph5.PNG" alt="" />
          <p>
            You could use Pinterest to create inspiration boards for different
            nail experiments and trendy designs for potential shoppers. On
            Instagram, focus on publishing carousel posts, which work well for
            two reasons: <br />
            1. You can show off all the different nail polish styles and color
            shades in your store. <br />
            2. No matter what size <br />
            following you have, carousel posts receive up to 5.13% higher
            engagement compared to regular posts, according to research from
            SocialInsider.

          <p>
            <strong class="text-danger" id="3"> 3. Exercise bands</strong>
            Exercise resistance bands have quickly become one of the best
            selling products online, to no surprise. Given mandatory government
            shutdowns of gyms around the world due to the coronavirus, there’s
            been a growing trend in at-home exercise equipment.
          </p>
          <img src="../assets/blogs/blog1/ph6.PNG" alt="" />
          <p>
            According to Keywords Everywhere, top searches are: <br />
            • Resistance bands: 673,000/mo<br />
            • Exercise bands: 25,000/mo<br />
            • Exercise resistance bands: 5,300 /mo<br />
            By focusing on niche products like exercise resistance bands, you
            can create blog, video, and social media content around at-home
            workouts. Doing this, your store will attract higher quality leads
            more likely to buy your products.
          </p>
          <img src="../assets/blogs/blog1/ph7.PNG" alt="" />
          <p>
            Since at-home exercise may keep trending for a long time, you can
            also build a brand around fitness and optimize your product pages to
            rank in Google and bring in organic traffic. You can bundle together
            resistance bands with other trending products in your store or run
            Google Shopping and Facebook ads to target high-intent buyers and
            drive immediate sales.

            <strong class="text-danger" id="4"> 4. Water bottles</strong> <br />
            The global reusable water bottle market is already valued at $8.1
            billion as of 2018, and is expected to continue
            <a
              href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/reusable-water-bottle-market"
              >growing by a CAGR of 3.9%</a
            >
            until 2025. Trend data from Keywords Everywhere shows the following
            search volume: <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            • Water bottles: 103,000/mo<br />
            • Reusable water bottles: 27,100/mo<br />
            • Sports water bottle: 14,800/mo<br />
            • Custom water bottles: 22,200/mo<br />
          </p>

              >Google Trends</a
            >
            data also shows a steady increase in interest for water bottles,
            which indicates an increase in demand for this trending product you
            can add to your online store.
          </p>
          <img src="../assets/blogs/blog1/ph8.PNG" alt="" />
          <p>
            Increasing threats to the environment from non-reusable bottles and
            the rise in people leaning toward a healthy lifestyle drive this
            trend. Your target audience is likely to be more health-conscious
            and aware of the harmful effects of one-time-use bottles.
          </p>
          <img src="../assets/blogs/blog1/ph9.PNG" alt="" />
          <p>
            To market this bestseller, you’ll want to show these water bottles
            in use. For example, you could run a contest where customers post
            pictures of their water bottle out in the wild. Or, create staged
            photos of the water bottles in an eco-friendly setting and post them
            on social media and use them in ads.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can build a Custom Audience in Facebook Ads Manager and target
            specific groups of people. Or, run Google Ads for the keywords
            “reusable water bottles” so you can target customers actively
            searching for similar products.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong class="text-danger" id="5">5. Blankets</strong><br />
            If you want to sell a product that has a high-profit margin, look
            into selling blankets.
          </p>
          <p>
            These days, consumers are spending more and more money keeping their
            homes cozy and warm during colder seasons. According to research by
            <a
              href="https://www.futuremarketinsights.com/reports/blanket-market"
              >Future Market Insights</a
            >, the increase in demand is driving the blanket market, valued at
            $6.6 billion in 2018, to reach an estimated $9.9 billion by 2027,
            growing by a CAGR of 4.6%.
          </p>
          <p>
            <a
              href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&geo=US&q=blankets"
              >Google Trends</a
            >
            confirms this research by showing a noticeable uptrend over the past
            few years, with sharp peaks during the winter.
          </p>
          <img src="../assets/blogs/blog1/ph10.PNG" alt="" />
          <p>
            Research also shows that people are leaning more toward sustainable
            blankets that are also modern, decorative, stylish, and
            comfortable—like wool, which retailers are making more money selling
            than they are from cotton or polyester blankets. You can also sell
            custom-made blankets by teaming up with one of the many
            <a href="https://www.shopify.com/blog/print-on-demand-companies"
              >print-on-demand companies</a
            >
            out there and letting new customers build their own.
          </p>
          <img src="../assets/blogs/blog1/ph11.PNG" alt="" />
          <p>
            You can sell items online like blankets through a paid search
            strategy. Run ads on Google for keywords such as “wool blankets” or
            “fleece blankets,” which generate 40,500 searches and 49,500
            searches, respectively. Depending on what type of blanket you sell,
            you can also target more specific keywords, such as “wool camping
            blanket” or “blue and white throw blanket” to narrow in on
            higher-intent buyers.
          </p>
          <p>
            For social media, you can create video content to show off the
            benefits of your blankets. And show other creative uses for them
            besides just keeping you warm in bed. You can also run seasonal
            giveaways to promote new blankets and bestsellers. Or run Facebook
            ads for people in the market to buy a new blanket.

            confirms this uptick in interest.

            There are 191,000 monthly searches for yoga mats, proving the
            industry’s popularity. Newer search interest is popping up for
            eco-friendly and non-toxic yoga mats, which are expected to grow
            faster over the coming years than traditional polyvinyl chloride
            (PVC) mats that harm the environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            When marketing top-selling items like yoga mats, pay attention to
            what your target audience is looking at on social media. For
            yoga-goers, the trend leans into bright and natural lit spaces with
            a more organic feel.
          </p>
          <img src="../assets/blogs/blog1/ph13.PNG" alt="" />
          <p>
            Take photos of people using your yoga mats in a minimal and calming
            space—whether it be your living room or home office. Post them on
            social media channels like Instagram and Pinterest. Then, team up
            with influencers in the space to help promote your products
            organically. Consider providing yoga routines on platforms like
            Instagram and YouTube to help attract the right customers.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you want to run ads but have a limited budget, consider the
            seasonality of yoga mats. Good times during the year to market yoga
            mats could be:
          </p>
          <p>
            1. “New year, new me” season in January and February <br />
            2. Early summer in June when the outdoor lifestyle trend starts
            <br />
            3. Gifting season in November and December <br />
            You’ll likely want to explore Facebook ads to send traffic to your
            website and drive sales during peak buying seasons. If you want to
            expand your product line, you can easily find new yoga apparel and
            accessories to sell using a

            <strong class="text-danger" id="7">7. Kayak accessories</strong> <br />
            Kayaking just keeps growing in popularity year over year, with
            around 11.3 million recreational kayakers in the United States, with
            a CAGR of 12.9% per year through 2021. Kayak accessories—such as sun
            shades, tail blowers, seats, paddles, and dry bags—improve a trip’s
            safety and performance.
          </p>
          <p>
            According to
            <a
              href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&geo=US&q=kayak%20accessories"
              >Google Trends</a
            >, kayak accessories trend in pre-summer months, then pick up again
            after the holiday season.

          <img src="../assets/blogs/blog1/ph154.PNG" alt="" />
          <p>
            If you run an outdoor sports shop online, there are plenty of ways
            to market kayak accessories:
          </p>
          <p>
            1. Share kayaking adventure stories on your blog <br />
            2. Create guides for popular kayaking areas <br />
            3. Make product demos and customer video testimonials <br />
            4. Use Instagram tags and stickers on Instagram Stories to let
            people buy easily <br />
            5. Run Facebook ads to Messenger and show curated offerings <br />
          </p>
          <img src="../assets/blogs/blog1/ph15.PNG" alt="" />
          <p>
            Another focus is Google Search. With nearly 33,100 people searching
            for “kayak accessories” online, you can target ads to high-intent
            shoppers and send them to your store to purchase.

            <strong class="text-danger" id="8">8. Jigsaw puzzles</strong>
            Jigsaw puzzles have been a popular pastime activity since the 1760s.
            They’re a great way to relieve stress and create something
            beautiful. Today, artists and companies are exploring new and fun
            ways to reimagine the jigsaw puzzle.
          </p>
          <p>
            With 823,000 average monthly searches for the term “jigsaw puzzle,”
            it’s clear they are making a comeback in the 2020s.
            <a
              href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&q=jigsaw%20puzzles"
              >Google Trends</a
            >
            shows an immediate spike in interest after government mandated
            lockdowns due to COVID-19, following a steady trend forward.
          </p>
          <img src="../assets/blogs/blog1/ph16.PNG" alt="" />
          <p>
            According to <a href="">one global research study</a>, the jigsaw
            puzzle market sits at around $9.1 billion today, and expects a
            growth CAGR of 15.1% by 2025. The main driver (besides being stuck
            at home in quarantine)? Parents’ preference to give their kids toys
            that are fun and increase knowledge and innovation.
          </p>
          <img src="../assets/blogs/blog1/ph17.PNG" alt="" />
          <p>
            When it comes to promoting jigsaw puzzles, you’ll likely want to
            start by deciding on a few niches, such as kids puzzles or wooden
            puzzles. This will help you target ads to the right people. You
            could also start a social media campaign to repost completed puzzles
            from recent customers. Or run a contest to give away free puzzles to
            grow your email or Messenger marketing subscriber lists.
          </p>
          <p>
            Customer reviews are always a smart move for selling items like
            puzzles online. Testimonials can help shoppers decide if the product
            is perfect for them and encourage a sale.

              >9. Kitchen and dining room furniture</strong
            ><br />
            There’s been a growing trend in searches for “kitchen furniture” and
            “dining room furniture” in recent months. People are spending more
            time at home and looking to spruce up their living spaces. Google
            Trends shows these two categories reaching peak interest over the
            next month, so if you’re looking for winning products to sell, act
            fast.
          </p>
          <img src="../assets/blogs/blog1/ph18.PNG" alt="" />
          <p>
            The term “kitchen furniture” generates 49,500 searches per month,
            with related keywords like “table sets” and “kitchen chairs”
            reaching 110,000 and 60,500 searches per month, respectively.
          </p>
          <img src="../assets/blogs/blog1/ph19.PNG" alt="" />
          <p>
            While “dining room furniture” only generates 40,500 searches per
            month, there are many variations you could go also target with an
            SEO strategy, including:
          </p>
          <p>
            • Dining room sets: 201,000/mo <br />
            • Dining room chairs: 135,000/mo<br />
            • Dining room tables: 110,000/mo<br />
            • Small dining room sets: 8,100/mo<br />
          </p>
          <img src="../assets/blogs/blog1/ph20.PNG" alt="" />

            for dining furniture related keywords.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can create a blog with interior design tips and tricks with
            links back to your products. Then, run retargeting ads to your blog
            traffic on Facebook or Google.
          </p>
          <p>
            When running ads, try to target longer-tail keywords based on your
            product description, like “rustic wood dining table,” or “small
            kitchen table and chairs,” to attract customers who already know
            what they want. If you show up in front of them, they’re more likely
            to buy from your ecommerce store
          </p>

            <strong class="text-danger" id="10">10. Rugs</strong> <br />
            One recent trending product cropping up this quarter is rugs.
            Similar to other trending products in the home decor department,
            we’re probably seeing an increase due to the recent work-from-home
            trend. Area rugs bring together all the elements of a room and make
            spaces more cozy and welcoming.
          </p>

          <p>
            <a

              >Google Trends</a
            >
            shows the search term “rugs” hitting peak interest for the first
            time in five years
          </p>
          <img src="../assets/blogs/blog1/ph21.PNG" alt="" />
          <p>
            The search term “rugs” is generating 673,000 searches per month,
            with related terms “area rugs” bringing in 246,000 searches per
            month and “rugs for sale” generating 90,500 searches per month.
            There are also many rug types and styles available to sell, which
            gives you a lot of new

              >product opportunities</a
            >
            as you expand your line.
          </p>
          <p>
            Start by narrowing down what kind of rugs you want to sell—braided,
            outdoor, shag, area rugs, etc.—then promote your rugs on popular
            home decor blogs. You can reach out to them online and ask them to
            link back to products on your website from round up articles. People
            are more likely to buy when they come to your site through an
            external blog post than an ad. Then, run retargeting ads to people
            who viewed the product but didn’t buy to win back the sale.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another option is partnering or collaborating with interior
            designers to help promote new products to their audiences. If a
            product recommendation comes from a trusted source, shoppers are
            more likely to buy.

            <strong class="text-danger" id="11">11. Board games</strong> <br />
            Board games are another one of the most popular products to sell in
            2020. They’re an easy way to get the family together to laugh,
            relieve stress, and lower screen time. The term “board games” gets
            673,000 monthly searches, and “board games for kids” and “board
            games for adults” get 60,500 per
          </p>
          <p>
            month and 33,100 per month, respectively—so it’s a heavily searched
            product.

            According to

              >Google Trends</a
            >, search volume typically peaks around the holiday shopping season
            but gained extra attention this year between March and June. Expect
            these trending items to gain interest again in the coming months,
            based on past trends.

            To promote the bestselling products online, like board games, become
            an active member of forums and Facebook groups to share your skills
            and insights. Building community in <a href="https://www.shopify.com/blog/niche-markets">niche markets</a> like these will
            help you reach your target audience faster and easier. Get featured
            on round-up articles for the best board games or become a host on
            podcasts in the industry.

          </p>
          <img src="../assets/blog1/ph24.PNG" alt="">
          <p>
            Search volume for the term “laptop skins” gets around 33,100 searches per month, according to Keywords Everywhere.
