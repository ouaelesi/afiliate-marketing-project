                        <strong>What is The Dropshipping <br>[Updated]</strong>
                    </h1>
                    <!-- blog_body -->
                    <p>Have you ever wanted to sell products, but you worry about taking the risk of keeping it in stock, well I would like to inform you that there is a way to sell whatever you like without buying it first. It calls dropshipping, it’s a business when you can only order products from a supplier when you receive orders </p>
            
                    <p>Millions of entrepreneurs flock to dropshipping because it requires less hassle and money to get started. Maybe this is what makes you interested! With dropshipping, you can build a business that’s sustainable in the long term right from your laptop
            
                    </p>
                    <div class="section">
                        <strong class="text-danger">Benefits of Dropshipping</strong>
                        <div class="pl-5">
                           <p>1.Dropshipping doesn’t require a lot of money to start. you can get started with minimal funds and build the entire business right from your laptop, and you don’t need to make any high-level risky investments. Even when your business grows, your costs will stay low, especially if you compare it to traditional business expenses.</p>
            
                           <p>2. Dropshipping is easy to start. You don’t need to be a business expert to get started. If you take some time to learn the basics, you can get started quickly and learn the rest as you go along. Also, you don’t need a warehouse to store products or a team to help you out. You don’t have to worry about stocking or shipping either. You don’t even have to spend a certain amount of time every day in your store. It’s surprisingly hands-off, especially once you get going. All of this means that you can start your business today. You can start getting everything up and running within a matter of hours. You will need some foundational knowledge and the right tools and resources, and that’s why we created this guide. By the time you’ve finished it, you’ll be equipped with the knowledge you need to jumpstart your own dropshipping business. 
            </p>
                           <p>3. a good way to test products <br>
            
                            Dropshipping is a useful fulfillment method for both launching a new store and for business owners looking to test the appetite customers have for additional product categories, e.g., accessories or wholly new product lines. The main benefit of dropshipping is, again, the ability to list and potentially sell products before committing to buying a large amount of inventory.
                            </p>
                           <p>4. If you are one of the types that like to be his/her own boss then this business is perfect for you because the dropshipping gives you high flexibility that you can work from home with a laptop, and you can work at the times that are most convenient for you, it is so flexible that you can work on your strategies while you are in vacation, the only thing u need is a clear connection to the internet 
            
                           </p>
                           <p>5. dropshipping is one of the easiest business to grow, why? Ok let's take an example, let’s say you opened a local store to sell any product so you need to pay the rent first, buy the products from suppliers or machinery if you are producing something, and that gives you a monthly expense, which makes it hard for your business to grow fast but, in the other side when you open a dropshipping business you will need a none of that, that's right you have to work hard in the first just like any business but you will notice that working hours and expenses decrease by the time, and your business grows rapidly and that's because the online business has a better return on investment(ROI) then a local one by far
            
                           </p>
                           <p>6. Wide selection of products to sell <br>
            
            Since you don’t have to pre-purchase the items you sell, you can offer an array of <a href="https://www.shopify.com/blog/trending-products">shopify</a> to your potential customers. If suppliers stock an item, you can list it for sale on your online store at no additional cost.</p>

                        <strong class="text-danger">Disadvantages of Dropshipping:</strong>
                        <p>
                            All the benefits we mentioned make dropshipping a very attractive model for anyone getting started with an online store, But like all other businesses, dropshipping has its downsides too.   
        
                        </p>
                        <div class="pl-5">
                            <strong>1. Shipping complexities</strong>
                            <p>If you work with multiple suppliers (as most drop shippers do) the products on your online store will be sourced through several different drop shippers. This complicates your shipping costs. Let’s say a customer places an order for three items, all of which are available only from separate suppliers. You’ll incur three separate shipping charges for sending each item to the customer, but it’s probably not wise to pass this charge along to the customer. And even when it does make sense to include these charges, automating these calculations can be difficult.
        
                            </p>
                            <strong>2. Supplier errors</strong>
                            <p>Have you ever been blamed for something that wasn’t your fault, but you had to accept responsibility for the mistake anyway? Even the best dropshipping suppliers make mistakes fulfilling orders—mistakes for which you have to take responsibility and apologize. And mediocre and low-quality suppliers will cause endless frustration with missing items, botched shipments, and low-quality packing, which can damage your business’s reputation.
        
                            </p>
                            <strong>3. Low margins </strong>
                            <p>Low margins are the biggest disadvantage of operating in a highly competitive dropshipping vertical. Because it’s so easy to get started, and the overhead costs are so minimal, many competing stores will set up shop and sell items at rock-bottom prices in an attempt to grow revenue. Since they’ve invested so little in getting the business started, they can afford to operate on minuscule margins. But you can do a lot to 
                                mitigate this problem by selecting a niche/vertical that’s well suited for dropshipping. We’ll discuss how to do exactly that in Chapter 4.
                            </p>
                            <strong>4.Limited customization and branding</strong>
                            <p>Unlike custom-made products or print on demand, dropshipping doesn’t give you a lot of control over the product itself. Usually, a product drop shipped is designed and branded by the supplier.

                        <strong class="text-danger">How much do I need to invest to start dropshipping?</strong>
                        <p>
                            Though it’s hard to predict the exact costs for any individual business, there are a few items every dropshipping business will need to spend money on in order to get started. Here’s a quick summary of the essential costs.
        
                        </p>
                        <div class="pl-5">
                            <strong class="text-success">Online store</strong>
                            <p>Estimated cost: ~$29/month <br>
                                You’ll need to find an ecommerce platform or website builder in order to create and host your online store. We will discuss this later 
                                </p>
                            <strong class="text-success">Domain name</strong>
                            <p>Estimated cost: $5-20/year <br>
        It’s hard to build trust with customers without your own domain name. While there are a number of top-level domains available (e.g., example.shop, example.co), we recommend looking for a ” .com”  that fits your brand, if one is available. <a href=""> Here is the cheapest websites to buy a great domain names</a>   </p>
                            <strong class="text-success">Test orders</strong>
                            <p>Estimated cost: Varies <br>
                                Although dropshipping lets you have minimal involvement with handling your overall product catalog, you should set aside money, as well as a little bit of time, to test out the products you plan to sell. If you don’t, you risk listing a product with too many shortcomings or defects, which will result in unhappy customers and a lot of time spent dealing with returns.
                                </p>
                            <strong class="text-success">Online advertising</strong>
                            <p>Estimated cost: Scales with your business; we recommend budgeting at least $500 to get started <br>
                                Every eCommerce business should look for ways to reduce their average cost to acquire a customer through organic channels like content <a href="">marketing</a> ,<a href="">SEO</a> , and word of mouth. But to get started, advertising is usually an essential channel for most product-based businesses. The most common channels include search engine marketing (SEM), display ads, social media ads, and mobile ads.
